# LatinWords
A Java application which identifies Latin nominative forms.

Based on 'Latinan alkeiskurssi opetusmoniste' by Jyri Vaahtera, Turku: Turun yliopisto, 1999.

(All grammatical errors are due to my limited knowledge.)

Wrote this to learn how to read and manipulate Strings while doing an Introduction to Programming course with Java.

Go to LatinWords/Latin_words/src/latin_words/ for the actual code.

ToDo:

- reading the noun endings from an external file insted of coding them in the application
